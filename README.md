Shibboleth version 3.3 and later include a native Duo authentication login flow. Please do not try to use the instructions on this page with Shibboleth v3.3 or later. 

See the [DuoAuthnConfiguration documentation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/DuoAuthnConfiguration) for more information about the built-in Duo flow in Shibboleth v3.3.
